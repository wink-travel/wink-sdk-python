    Wink API

     # Introduction  Welcome to the Wink API - A programmer-friendly way to manage, sell and book travel blocking on the Wink platform. The API gives you all the tools you need to ready your properties and blocking for sale across 1000s of our native sales channels.  Integrators, affiliates, travel agents and content creators have the ability search for your travel blocking and promote / sell it in a wide variety of ways.   # Integrations  We have already integrated with the most well-known channel managers so you don't have to. To see our current integrations, please go to https://extranet.wink.travel and scroll to Connectivity section. Once your properties are set up, you can finish the setup by mapping your property to Wink using your channel manager partner portal. If your properties don't have a channel manager, you can easily manage rates and availability with this API.   # Intended Audience  Programmers are [most likely] a requirement to start integrating with Wink. Companies and organizations that would most benefit from integrating with us are new and existing travel companies that have relationships with suppliers and that need an advanced system from which to manage their travel blocking and get that same blocking out to as many eyeballs as possible at the lowest price possible.  - Hotel chains  - Hotel brands  - Travel tech companies  - Destination sites  - Integrators  - Aggregators  - Destination management companies  - Travel agencies  - OTAs   ## APIs  Not every integrator needs every API. For that reason, we have separated APIs into context.  ### Test API   - [Ping](/ping): The Ping API is a quick test endpoint to verify that your credentials work Wink.  ### Common APIs  - [Notifications](/notifications): The Notifications API is a way for us to stay in touch with your user, property or affiliate account. - [User Settings](/user-settings): The User Settings API exposes endpoints to allow 3rd party integrators to communicate with Wink.  ### Consume APIs Consume endpoints are for developers who want to find existing travel blocking and either book it or use it to advertise through one of their Wink affiliate accounts.   - [Configuration](/engine-client): A single endpoint to retrieve whitelabel + customization information for the booking engine.  - [Lookup](/lookup): All APIs related to locating blocking by region, locale and property flags.  - [Inventory](/blocking): All APIs related to retrieve known travel blocking as it was found using the Lookup API..  - [Booking](/booking): All APIs related to creating bookings on the platform.  - [Travel Agent](/travel-agent): The Travel Agent API exposes endpoints to manage agent-facilitated bookings.   ### Produce APIs  Produce endpoints are for developers who want to create and manage travel blocking.   #### Property  - [Property registration](/extranet/property/register): As a producer, this is, oftentimes, where you start your journey.

If you don't see your language here, reach out to us with a request to officially add your language. In the meantime, if you want to roll your own SDK, you can do so by downloading the OpenAPI spec and using one of the many available OpenAPI generators available: [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators).   - Java SDK [https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java](https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java)   ## Usage  These features are made available to you via a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This API is language agnostic.   ## Versioning  We chose to version our endpoints in a way that we hope affects your integration minimally. You request the version of our API you wish to work with via the `Wink-Version` header. When it's time for you to upgrade, you only have to change the version number to get access to our updated endpoints.   ## Release history  - Follow updates on Github: https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md    # WinkLinks API The WinkLinks API exposes endpoints to manage WinkLink entries, categories and settings. This API lets you:  1. Entries: Manage WinkLinks entries. 2. Categories: Manage WinkLinks tags. 2. Settings: Configure WinkLinks account.  Browse the endpoints in the left navigation bar to get started.
